[Gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle) extension for Kotlin

This was originally implemented by @jbedard in https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-cli
and has been separated out to a standalone git repository and Bazel module.

The work was sponsored by @reddaly and the GoogleX Tapestry team, thanks so much!
